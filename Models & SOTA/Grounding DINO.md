**Overview**
Grounding DINO extends a closed-set object detection model with a text encoder, enabling open-set object detection



### Model Architecture

* More details...

* Grounding DINO aims to merge concepts found in the [DINO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03605.pdf?ref=blog.roboflow.com) and [GLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03857.pdf?ref=blog.roboflow.com) papers.

* Grounding DINO often leverages DINOv2 as its backbone, benefiting from its strong visual understanding\
