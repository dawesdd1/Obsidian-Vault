### Core differences

1. ROS2 uses 3rd party middleware called `DDS (Data Distribution Service)` 
	* DDS provides a publish-subscribe transport which is very similar to ROSâ€™s pub-sub transport. 
2. No ROS Master (orchestrator) in ROS2
3. Shared C++ and Python implementation 
4. Multiple processes in one ROS node
5. Action services
6. Windows compatibility and support for ROS2 (lol)
7. Launch files for python source files
