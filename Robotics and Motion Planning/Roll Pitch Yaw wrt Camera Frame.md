### Attitude (where Z-is in/out) 

- **Roll (ϕ)**: Rotation around the Z-axis (in-out axis). In the camera frame, this would be rolling left or right as seen by the camera.

- **Pitch (θ)**: Rotation around the X-axis (left-right axis). In the camera frame, this would tilt the camera/drone up or down, which affects the view in the up-down direction.

- **Yaw (ψ)**: Rotation around the Y-axis (up-down axis). In the camera frame, this would rotate the camera/drone to the left or right, changing the direction of the view along the horizontal plane.

### Attitude (where Z-is up/down)

* **Roll (ϕ)**: Rotation around the X-axis (in-out axis). In this coordinate system the plane/ship would be rolling left or right as seen by the camera.

- **Pitch (θ)**: Rotation around the Y-axis (left-right axis). In the camera frame, this would tilt the plan/ship up or down, which affects the view in the up-down direction.

- **Yaw (ψ)**: Rotation around the Z-axis (up-down axis). In the camera frame, this would rotate the plane/ship to the left or right, changing the direction of the view along the horizontal plane.
