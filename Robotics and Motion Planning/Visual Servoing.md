**Overview**
vision based robotic motion control

*g* → grasp success
$I_t$ → 
$v_t$ → 
*g($I_t$, $v_t$)* → predicted grasp success based on $I_t$ and $v_t$
*f($I_t$)* → servoing mechanism

### RW Applications

`visp_ros` -- is an open-source visual servoing library that provides tools to control robots using visual data. It offers a variety of control schemes like 2D, 3D, and hybrid visual servoing.

Position-based visual servoing estimate the object and drones pose in $\mathbb{R}^3$ space

##### Out-of-the-box / Custom Solutions
- DeepVS: A deep learning-based visual servoing framework, though you may need to adapt it for drone control.
- PoseNet:
